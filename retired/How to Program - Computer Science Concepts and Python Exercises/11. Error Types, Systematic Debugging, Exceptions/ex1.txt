When testing your code for the ticket pricing logic, you would want to use a range of ages that cover all the boundary conditions and typical cases. Here's a list of age values that would be good to use in your tests:

Test with an age less than 3 (e.g., 0, 1, 2) to ensure the ticket is free.
Test exactly at the boundary of 3 to verify that the child pricing starts correctly.
Test with an age between 3 and 12 (e.g., 4, 7, 11) to ensure the child pricing is applied.
Test exactly at the boundary of 12 to ensure that the child pricing still applies.
Test just above the boundary (e.g., 13) to ensure that adult pricing starts correctly.
Test with a typical adult age (e.g., 30) to ensure the adult pricing is applied generally.
It may also be worthwhile to test with an edge case of a very high age (e.g., 90) to ensure there are no unexpected issues with unusually high input values.
By testing these specific age values, you can ensure that your code handles all the different scenarios correctly.
